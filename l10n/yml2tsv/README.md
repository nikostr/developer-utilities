# `yml2tsv` localization message converter utility
This utility script converts the tree of YAML files used in the Zetkin front-end
apps to TSV (tab-separated values) that can be easily pasted into Excel or
Google Spreadsheets for easier editing for non-developer translators.

## Usage
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start /path/to/www.zetk.in/locale
```

TSV output is printed to stdout.
